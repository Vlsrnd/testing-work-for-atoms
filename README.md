<p>Because this is only a part of the project without a global store,
in some places, not the best architecture solutions were applied :shit:</p>

Install:

`npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

If you want to build this, you need to change "homepage" in package.json and then:

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
